If multiple: “Pick one. If everything else fails, this one still matters.”
“What are the three biggest bottlenecks that could stop you?”
“What are the three actions that, if you do them, guarantee you complete the objective?”
If vague: “Rewrite as a concrete action with an outcome.”
“What do you need to STOP doing this week?”
“What do you need to START doing?”
“What worked that you should CONTINUE?”
“Commitment level 1–10. If it’s under 8, what must change?”
