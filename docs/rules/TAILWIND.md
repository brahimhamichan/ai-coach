# Tailwind CSS Rules

- Use responsive prefixes for mobile-first design.
- Use state variants for interactive elements (hover, focus, etc).
- Use `@apply` for repeated patterns when necessary within `@layer components`.
- Use arbitrary values `[]` for specific requirements not covered by utilities.
- Use spacing utilities for consistent layout.
