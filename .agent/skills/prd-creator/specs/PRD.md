# PRD Creator - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The core problem this product solves is: Software development teams face challenges when creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). Traditional PRD creation is time-consuming, requires significant domain expertise, and often results in inconsistent quality. Teams struggle to structure their product ideas into professional, detailed documents that development teams can work from effectively.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is: An intelligent Product Requirements Document (PRD) generator powered by Google's Gemini AI. The application transforms product ideas into comprehensive, professional PRDs in minutes with an intuitive interface. Users can describe their product concept in plain text, and the AI will generate a structured, detailed PRD suitable for development teams.

### 1.3 Vision

The vision is to become the standard tool for product managers and development teams to quickly generate professional PRDs. We aim to democratize product planning by making it accessible to startups, individual entrepreneurs, and established companies alike. Our long-term goal is to create an AI-powered product planning suite that assists with every stage of product development, from initial concept to feature prioritization and roadmap planning.
